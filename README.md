## END's item listing page

Hope this finds you well, 

as agreed here is my take on END's item listing page

## info
 MVVM archetecture with ViewModel and LiveData
 RxJava
 Dagger2 , i took the liberty of implementing this but will also try to refactor it to Hilt, 
 as its fresh on my mind i may as well do it on a new branch 
 Repository pattern
 Unit tests for ViewModel
 
## how could this be improved?
along with RoomDb for remote/loss of connection i would add a swipe down to refresh function,
add a loading animation with background greyed out or set to gone, Event handlers for Loading/Error/Success

Thanks for your time,

Ali
